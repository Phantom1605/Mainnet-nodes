# Non-custodial and Secure staking provider [Alex845](https://github.com/Phantom1605)
- **My main priority is security of the staking service.**
- üíª I've worked as a devops for 5 years and have excellent skills in configuring server security.
- üõ†Ô∏è I constantly introduce new practices for the reliability of my servers, first in test networks, and with stable operation - in the mainnet.
- üõ†Ô∏è There are tools, like scripts and [State Sync](https://github.com/Phantom1605/State-Sync-Snapshots/blob/main/README.md) for for quick synchronization of new validators, or for moving to new servers  
- üíØ In case of a black swan (there will be a slashing of my validator) I will make a 100% refund!
